# My Cool Project

## How to Run

Compile it yourself. Make sure you're on `SDK-v1.17` or `SDK-v1.19`, version 1.20 might work but I haven't tried it. Make sure you choose the right version for your environment, between `undecipherableName1` and `UndecipherableNameB`.

## API Reference

Names are self explanatory.
